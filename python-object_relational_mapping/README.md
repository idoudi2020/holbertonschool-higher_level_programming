Object-relational mapping (ORM) in Python is a technique used to interact with databases by mapping database tables to Python objects. This simplifies database interactions by allowing developers to work with objects and classes rather than writing SQL queries directly. There are several popular ORM libraries in Python, such as SQLAlchemy, Django ORM (part of the Django web framework), Peewee, and more.
